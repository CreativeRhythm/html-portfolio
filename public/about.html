<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Rhythm is a bright, creative, and curious girl who loves exploring new ideas across all kinds of activities. Whether
   she’s diving into school projects, preparing for exams, or learning something completely new, she always brings her own
   style, imagination, and enthusiasm. She has a natural ability to make every task interesting and aesthetic, whether it’s 
   customizing a Ludo board, designing a scrapbook, or working on her Me Zone with pastel colors.

</p>

<p>She is also someone who balances hard work with artistic expression. Rhythm enjoys reading—especially Percy Jackson—writing
   chapters of her own book, crafting DIY gifts, and upgrading everyday things with her personal touch. She puts effort into her 
   studies too, especially French, math, and science, and always tries to improve, even when the topic is new or challenging. Her
   creativity spills into everything she does, from performances to holiday homework to little inventions for her bag or room.
</p>

<p>Most importantly, Rhythm has a kind and thoughtful personality. She helps around the house, takes care of little tasks without being
   asked, and often thinks about making others smile—like through handmade gifts for her mom or acts of kindness. She’s imaginative,
   expressive, stylish, and full of ideas, and she’s becoming more confident every day. Rhythm has that rare blend of talent, effort,
   and heart that makes her truly unique.</p>
